Hi there :)

Thank you for using this asset!

Sprites are separated into a few different categories:
- Tilesets: Includes all the tilesets.
- Backgrounds & Foregrounds: Contains parallax backgrounds and foregrounds.
- Props: Includes objects, visual elements, and other props to decorate your level.
- Environment: Covers natural elements such as grass, moss, trees, bushes, plants, etc.
- Buildings: Contains sprites related to buildings, allowing you to compose structures from different parts or use precomposed sections.
- Decals: Decorative elements that can be placed on walls or other objects, such as posters and graffiti.
- Characters: Contains animals and creatures.
- Vehicles: Contains cars, vans, trucks, trains, and train interiors.

The bitmask for autotiling is visualized in the Sprites/Tilesets/Bitmask image.

If you have any feedback or ideas for things you think could improve this asset, or things that you need for your games, please don't hesitate to send me a message. I'd be happy to add it.

Happy game developing!
